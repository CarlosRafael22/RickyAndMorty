# Ricky And Morty Web App

Simple web app showing some of the characters of the TV series. You can see their general profile or more information going to their specific pages.

It was deployed on Vercel and can be acessed at: https://ricky-and-morty-carlosrafael22.vercel.app/

This is a really simple project that show the usage of Next.js with TypeScript and Styled Components.

## Notes

There are still more changes to be made in the UI and features of the web app, such as searching and filtering, but this is the initial version.
